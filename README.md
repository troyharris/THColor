THColor
=======

A category of UIColor for useful extensions to the class

As of right now, there is only one method:

```objective-c
[UIColor colorWithHex:(NSString *) withAlpha:(CGFloat)]
```
You can give this an HTML/CSS style color string to get a UIColor in return (For example: #FFFFFF, #FFF, ffffff, fff all return white)
